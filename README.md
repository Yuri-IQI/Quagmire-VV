# This is an attempt at a map browser game.

The main branch uses a python file with flask to take data from a psql database, do some processing and send it to the carta.js (main.js) file.

The functional-front branch doesn't use the python file run, some of the data that is processed in the python is already set in the carta.js (main.js). Thus, the program becomes a static site and can be hosted on GitHub pages and accessed through this link: https://yuri0000aaaaa.github.io/Quagmire-VV/
